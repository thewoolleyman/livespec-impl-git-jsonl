# worktree-lib.sh — portable, ecosystem-neutral worktree-lifecycle core.
#
# Generated from livespec/templates/impl-plugin/dev-tooling/worktree-lib.sh
# at copier-copy time; re-sync via `copier update --vcs-ref=master` when
# livespec publishes a new release.
#
# WHAT THIS IS
# ============
# The single source of truth for this repo's worktree discipline: every
# tracked-file mutation happens in an ISOLATED git worktree under
# ~/.worktrees/<repo>/<branch>, never on the shared primary checkout. This
# script implements the four lifecycle verbs the discipline needs —
# `create`, `hydrate`, `land`, `reap` — plus the portable primary-vs-linked
# detection they share.
#
# It is deliberately ECOSYSTEM-NEUTRAL and pure-git: it shells out to `git`
# only and makes NO assumption about Python/Rust/JS/etc., so it stays correct
# under any invocation (including before a task runner is resolvable). It is
# DRIVEN by `just`: the mandated `just worktree-{create,hydrate,land,reap}`
# recipes call this core directly — the core carries the logic, the recipes
# stay logic-free. `just` is mandated non-functionally across the fleet +
# adopters; where an ecosystem has a native tool, a strict pass-through wrapper
# (e.g. `cargo xtask worktree create` → `just worktree-create`) forwards to
# those recipes, never an alternative runner.
#
# PRIMARY-VS-LINKED DETECTION (the load-bearing primitive)
# ========================================================
# A git worktree is the PRIMARY checkout when `git rev-parse
# --git-common-dir` and `git rev-parse --git-dir` resolve to the SAME path;
# in a LINKED worktree they DIFFER (the git-dir is
# <primary>/.git/worktrees/<name>). This is config-free and portable: it
# needs no `git config` key, no environment marker, and works identically in
# every clone. The structural commit-refuse hook (installed from the shared
# livespec_dev_tooling package) uses the exact same test so the hook and the
# lifecycle helpers always agree on what "primary" means.
#
# HYDRATION IS AN OVERRIDABLE HOOK
# ================================
# "Hydrate" means something different per ecosystem (populate node_modules,
# create a .venv, warm a build cache, …). The core does NOT bake any of that
# in — it delegates hydration to an OVERRIDABLE hook that DEFAULTS TO A
# NO-OP. The hook is, in resolution order:
#   1. the command in the WORKTREE_HYDRATE_HOOK environment variable, if set;
#   2. an executable dev-tooling/worktree-hydrate.sh at the repo root, if
#      present;
#   3. otherwise nothing (a friendly no-op).
# The shipped dev-tooling/worktree-hydrate.sh is itself a no-op stub; a
# consuming repo replaces it with its ecosystem-correct hydration. (A future
# livespec release adds per-ecosystem hydrate profiles selected at scaffold
# time; this core does not need to change for that.)
#
# USAGE
#   ./dev-tooling/worktree-lib.sh detect            # print 'primary' or 'linked'
#   ./dev-tooling/worktree-lib.sh create <branch> [<base-ref>]
#   ./dev-tooling/worktree-lib.sh hydrate           # run the hydrate hook (no-op by default)
#   ./dev-tooling/worktree-lib.sh land [<base-ref>] # rebase onto base then report next step
#   ./dev-tooling/worktree-lib.sh reap [--execute] [--force]
#   ./dev-tooling/worktree-lib.sh help
#
# This script is sourceable too: `source worktree-lib.sh` exposes the
# worktree_* functions without dispatching a subcommand (the dispatcher only
# runs when the script is executed directly).

USAGE:

  worktree-lib.sh reap --execute        # actually remove
  worktree-lib.sh reap --execute --force  # include dirty / unmerged

SAFETY:
  Never touches the primary checkout or the worktree it runs from. Never
  removes a dirty or unmerged worktree without --force. NEVER run while
  another agent is actively working in a worktree — --force discards
  uncommitted changes. Reap only at session start, after a landed branch is
  confirmed merged and its agent exited, or at loop end.
